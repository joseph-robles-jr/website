<h1>Day 3: Debugging and Reverse Engineering</h1>
<h2>Challenge instructions</h2>
<p>For this lesson, you'll need the following two tools:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases">Ghidra</a>, a tool made by the NSA for
            reverse engineering software on tons of architectures</p>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>You need java to run this! Follow the installation instructions on the Ghidra page!</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <p>The GNU debugger, a tool made by GNU project for debugging, commonly referred to as GDB.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Linux: Install with your package manager.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Windows: Install MSYS2 and use mingw64. Run with "pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>MacOS: use brew (untested).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For each challenge, you will download a file and either inspect it with Ghidra or load it in to QEMU and debug it
    with GDB. Each flag begins with "CTF-" and ends with ";".</p>
<p>You may want to start qemu with the flags "-S" and "-s".</p>
<p>Run gdb and connect to qemu with "target remote localhost:1234".</p>
<h2>Challenges 1-3: GDB</h2>
<h3>Challenge 1: String on the Heap</h3>
<p>To play this challenge, download the following file: <a
        href="/learning/downloads/os-image-ctf1.bin">os-image-ctf1.bin</a></p>
<p>The heap in our kitty kernel starts at 0x10000. Can we read that memory?</p>
<h3>Challenge 2: Calling a function</h3>
<p>To play this challenge, download the following file: <a
        href="/learning/downloads/boot_sector-ctf2.bin">boot_sector-ctf2.bin</a></p>
<p>Our boot sector is loaded at 0x7c00, and in the third sector there exists a function to load in the second sector and
    print a string located there. Can we call that function?</p>
<h3>Challenge 3: Inspect the registers</h3>
<p>To play this challenge, download the following file: <a
        href="/learning/downloads/boot_sector-ctf3.bin">boot_sector-ctf3.bin</a></p>
<p>Instructions are in the binary :)</p>
