<h1>Day 2: Interrupts and Registers</h1>
<!--explain what we are doing with interrupts-->
<h2>What are Interrupts?</h2>
<p>Imagine that you are a kid helping you dad with a project in the garage. He is doing the work but you are bored. You
    stop him and ask him to get you a juice box. He sets down his tools, gets you your juice box, then goes back to
    work.</p>

<p>Congratulations! That is an interrupt.</p>

<p> In our scenario, your dad was the CPU. He was following instructions and working on a big task. When you tapped him
    on the shoulder was <i>interrupting</i> him. He stopped what he was doing and left what he was doing on his
    workbench. He then took care of the time sensitive task. When he was done, he picked back up where he left off.</p>

<p>We will talk about 3 types of interrupts today but there are tons more that you can discover on your own. The three
    that we will talk about today are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>int 0x10 (10h) - Bios Video Services</li>
    <li>int 0x13 (13h) - Disk Services</li>
    <li>int 0x16 (16h) - Keyboard services</li>
</ul>

<h2>int 0x10 (10h) - Bios Video Services</h2>
<!--Insert an example of using 'int 0x10' and an explanation of what it is-->
<p>
    "int" 10h is shorthand for BIOS interrupt call 0x10. This interrupt call is responsible for operations around the
    video mode. Examples of these operations (also called services) are:
<ul>
    <li>String output</li>
    <li>Reading and writing from/to individual pixels on the screen</li>
    <li>Setting video modes</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2> int 0x13 (13h) - Disk Services </h2>
<!--Insert an example of using 'int 0x13' and an explanation of what it is-->

<p>"int 13h" is shorthand for BIOS interrupt call 0x13. This interrupt call is responsible for reading and writing
    sectors (512 bytes) to the disk.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_13H" target="_blank"> int 0x13 (Disk Services) - Wikipedia </a>
<p> </p>


<h2>int 0x16 (16h) - Keyboard services</h2>
<!--Insert an example of using 'int 0x16' and an explanation of what it is-->

<p>"int 16h" is shorthand for BIOS interrupt call 0x16. This interrupt call is responsible for getting keystrokes or the
    keyboard buffer and clearing it.</p>

<h2>Using the interrupts</h2>
<p>Save the following file as "boot_functions.asm".</p>
<a href="/learning/downloads/boot_functions.asm">boot_functions.asm</a>
<p>Take a look at the code inside, and note how they call the bios functions for storage, keyboard, and video.</p>
<p>Now, download the file "boot_sector.asm" and put it inside the same directory as the previous file.</p>
<a href="/learning/downloads/boot_sector.asm">boot_sector.asm</a>
<p>You can run it with the following two commands:</p>
<div class="codeblock">
    <p>
        nasm boot_sector.asm -fbin -o boot_sector.bin<br>
        qemu-system-x86_64 .\boot_sector.bin
    </p>
</div>
<p>Pay attention to the output. How is the string stored in sector 2 printed? How did it get to address 0x8000?</p>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='learning/day2/SECTORS.svg') }}" alt="Sector and RAM diagram" width="100%">
<p>You can figure out how far a sector needs to be mapped from our first sector (located at 0x7C00) by adding 512 to it.
    <br>You can use any calculator (like the built in windows one) with hex capabilities. Here's a browser based one:
</p>
<a href="https://rinkcalc.app/" target="_blank"> Rink Calculator</a>
<p>To add with rink, try "0x7c00 + 512 in hex".</p>
<p>You can add your own code in the start and loop sections to try and make a little 16 bit real mode operating system!
